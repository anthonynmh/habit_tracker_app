# Introduction

- How is this habit tracker application defined?  
It is an application to:
  1. (goal) enforce or simplify a new or existing routine,
  2. (motivation) in an effort to achieve personal accountability,
  3. (method) through external cognition via cognitive offloading.

- Who may be interested in using this application?  
Users seeking to achieve personal accountability, through the enforcement of a new or existing routine. Specifically:
  1. Users with new routines
  - Internally/externally motivated
  - Seeks to enforce personal accountability
  2. Users with existing routines
  - Internally motivated
  - Seeks to simplify efforts in personal accountability 

- What is the success metric for the application?  
When users transition from using the application as means of enforcement to means of simplification; the routine becomes internally motivated, thus becoming a habit.  


# Development Philosophy

This project's development takes inspiration from [The Lean Startup](https://theleanstartup.com/) (Eric Reis).

Thus, the MVP is designed to encompass a minimal problem scope, with the goal of validating critical business assumptions.


# Considerations in first MVP

The brief description provided in the [Introduction](#introduction) section provides an initial scope for the project. 

The assumptions to validate are:
1. User types - validate if true, or if there exist more types of users.
2. User type motivations - internally or externally motivated.
3. Assumed needs of user types - more details in the [Persona](#persona) section.

Therefore, the MVP is **not** the production-grade application. It is a prototype to verify, and realign the business context for this project.

## Persona

1. Users with new routines  

Motivations:  
- Fear of an undesirable outcome, through the lack of commitment to a routine.
- Guilt from a lack of personal accountability.
- Non-relating perks (monetary incentives, achievements collection, etc).
  
Relevant themes:  
- Engaging
- Instructive
- Accountable

2. Users with existing routines

Motivations:  
- Perceived increased of productivity through the usage of the application.
- Proof of personal accountability (streaks, achievements, etc).
  
Relevant themes:
