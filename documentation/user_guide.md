# Usage Instructions

Eventually, users will be able to access the deployed application through either the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store.

However, given that the application is still in development, users wanting to try the application themselves have to follow the set up instructions below.


# Steps

### First Time Set-up

If you are trying to run the application locally for the first time, follow the instructions in the [Flutter Docs](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) to set up Flutter first.

### Clone the GitHub project

The following steps assumes basic knowledge in Git and scripting. If you are new, you may check out the documentations for [Git](https://git-scm.com/docs/user-manual) and [command prompt](https://www.digitalcitizen.life/command-prompt-how-use-basic-commands/).

1. Open terminal (or command prompt).
2. Navigate to your preferred project directory.
3. Clone the repo with the following.
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/anthonynmh/habit_tracker_app.git
  ```
4. Run the following code to download dependencies.
  ```
  flutter pub get
  ```
5. Open Visual Studio Code (or your preferred IDE).
6. If you are using a simulator, ensure that you have selected the correct simulator. Detailed instructions [here](https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/vs-code#selecting-a-target-device).
7. Run `lib/main.dart`.
