## Further Comments

1. I am new to Flutter, and have only started picking it up from the commencement of this project.
2. Given my recent introduction to Flutter, I have focused on structuring the project for clarity and future development.
3. I have decided to compensate for the current limited Flutter experience with a strong emphasis on planning, architecture, and documentation.
4. The work-in-progress is accounted for in the **Issues** tab.
