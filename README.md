## Further Comments

1. I fully understand the requirements of a habit tracker app, as listed in the google docs [description](https://docs.google.com/document/d/166T6-96cHJHI9X4X_7M2SsDXXBJnyLQWrl1mxNxcHgY/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.cd7sby8bn255).
2. I am new to Flutter, and have only started picking it up from the commencement of this project.
3. Given my recent introduction to Flutter, I have focused on structuring the project for clarity and future development.
4. I have decided to compensate for my limited Flutter experience with a strong emphasis on planning, architecture, and documentation.
5. The work-in-progress is accounted for in the **Issues** tab.
